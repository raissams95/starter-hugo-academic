abstract: 'Background: In 2005-2006, a chikungunya epidemic of unprecedented magnitude struck La RÃ©union, a southwestern Indian Ocean Island, causing 300,000 infections. Over time, significant public health concerns emerged due to long-lasting manifestations, particularly chronic rheumatic and chronic fatigue-related syndromes.
Methods: To investigate the pathophysiology underlying chronic chikungunya (CC), particularly the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), the CHIKGene study was initiated. Blood samples were collected from 133 individuals who experienced chronic symptoms, with 58 of them presenting persistent chronic fatigue-like symptoms, 11 to 14 years after exposure. RNA-Seq was performed on purified PBMCs followed by the comparison of the mRNA gene expression profiles between CFS and CC.
Results: Gene expression analysis between CFS and CC individuals identified only three differentially expressed genes (DEGs): EGR1, EGR2, and FOSB, all down-regulated in CFS compared to CC. These genes are linked to mood disorders, schizophrenia and stress-related conditions, indicating a possible connection between psychiatric disorders and chronic chikungunya. Metascape pathway analysis revealed significant immune response-related terms predominantly overexpressed in CC. DisGeNET analysis highlighted mood disorder-related pathways, also involving ACE and PTGS2 genes, both associated with CFS.
Conclusions: This study identified key DEGs and pathways in individuals with CFS linked to CC. Down-regulation of genes associated with mood disorders and immune response alterations in CFS suggests a novel genetic correlation with the chronicity of chikungunya. These findings emphasize the importance of these genetic markers in understanding, diagnosing and potentially developing therapies for long-term chikungunya effects, particularly its impact on mental health and immune function.
