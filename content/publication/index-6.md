abstract: Accidents involving spiders from the genus Loxosceles cause medical emergencies in several countries of South America. The species Loxosceles laeta is ubiquitously present in Peru and is responsible for severe accidents in this country. To further characterize L. laeta venom components and to unveil possible variations in the Peruvian population, we provide an overview of the toxins-related transcripts present in the venom gland of Peruvian L. laeta. A dataset from a cDNA library previously sequenced by MiSeq sequencer (Illumina) was re-analyzed and the obtained data was compared with available sequences from Loxosceles toxins. Phospholipase-D represent the majority (69,28 %) of the transcripts related to venom toxins, followed by metalloproteases (20,72 %), sicaritoxins (6,03 %), serine-proteases (2,28 %), hyaluronidases (1,80 %) and Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein (TCTP) (0,56 %). New sequences of phospholipases D,sicaritoxins, hyaluronidase, TCTP and serine proteinases were described. Differences between the here-described toxin sequences and others, previously identified in venom glands from other spiders, were visualized upon sequence alignments. In addition, an in vitro hyaluronidase activity assay was also performed to complement comparisons between Peruvian and Brazilian L. laeta venom enzymatic activities, revealing a superior activity in the venom from Brazilian specimens. These new data provide a molecular basis that can help to explain the difference in toxicity among L. laeta venoms from different countries in South America.
