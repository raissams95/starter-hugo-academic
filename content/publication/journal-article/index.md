abstract: Loxosceles spiders are found in almost all countries of South America. In Peru, Loxosceles laeta species is the main responsible for the accidents caused by poisonous animals, being known as “killer spiders”, due to the large number of fatal accidents observed. Astacin-like metalloproteases, named LALPs (Loxosceles astacin-like metalloproteases) are highly expressed in Loxosceles spiders venom gland. These proteases may be involved in hemorrhage and venom spreading, being relevant to the envenoming proccess. Thus, the aim of this work was to analyze Peruvian L. laeta venom gland transcripts using bioinformatics tools, focusing on LALPs. A cDNA library from Peruvian L. laeta venom glands was constructed and sequenced by MiSeq (Illumina) sequencer. After assembly, the resulting sequences were annotated, seeking out for similarity with previously described LALPs. Nine possible LALPs isoforms from Peruvian L. laeta venom were identified and the results were validated by in silico and in vitro experiments. This study contributes to a better understanding of the molecular diversity of Loxosceles venom and provide insights about the action of LALPs.
