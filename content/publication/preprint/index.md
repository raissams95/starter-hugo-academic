abstract: Response to the COVID-19 outbreak calls for rapid and accurate diagnostic tests to control the pandemic outbreak. We aimed to evaluate saliva specimen as well as rapid RT-LAMP test for diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This monocentric study screened outpatients that were either symptomatic or contact-cases of a COVID-19 confirmed case.Nasopharyngeal-swabs (NPS) and saliva were collected simultaneously and tested by RT-qPCR. Saliva samples were also analyzed using an extraction-free rapid RT-LAMP test (EasyCOV®). Infected participants were those with a positive (Ct value <35) NP and/or salivary RT-qPCR (Composite Reference Test, CRTest). Between the 1st September and the 7th of October 2020, samples of 443 adults were collected and analyzed. The mean age was 32·2 years, 59·4% declared mild symptoms at the time of sampling and 40·6% were asymptomatic. Positivity rate of NP and/or salivary RT-qPCR was 16·0% (71/443) and the concordance between these two methods was 87·3%. Sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP compared to CRTest were 85·9% (95% CI 77·8%-94·0%) and 99·5% (98·7%-100%), respectively. RT-LAMP accuracy was 91·0% and 98·2% compared to NP and salivary RT-qPCR, respectively. All 52 participants with a salivary RT-qPCR Ct value <31 were positive by RT-LAMP. Performances of RT-LAMP for symptomatic and asymptomatic participants were similar.
