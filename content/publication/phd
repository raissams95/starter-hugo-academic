title: Composition of Peruvian Loxosceles laeta venom revealed through NGS transcriptomic analysis and the development of the computational tool PepLess

summary: An example talk using Wowchemy's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: Accidents involving spiders of the Loxosceles genus are responsible for medical
emergencies in several countries in South America. The species Loxosceles laeta is
mainly found in Brazil and Peru, and it is responsible for an impressive number of
accidents in those countries. To further characterize the components of the L. laeta venom
and reveal possible variations in the particular Peruvian population, we provide an
overview of the toxins present in the Peruvian L. laeta venom gland, using a cDNA library
sequenced by the MiSeq sequencer (Illumina), and compared the data obtained with the
transcriptome based on Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) of venom glands of Brazilian L.
laeta from Fernandes-Pedrosa, 2008. The SPOT consists in the synthesis of a large
number of peptides on a cellulose membrane, and it is a simple and low-cost tool for
biotechnological applications and studies with large numbers of data, as is the case of the
transcriptomic analysis of Peruvian L. laeta. Nevertheless, this technique becomes
exhaustive when a large amount of sequences with different specifications is used, due to
the extensive time taken to produce membranes and manual analysis of immunoassays,
in addition to the excessive expenditure of materials and reagents. For these reasons, the
PepLess tool was developed. It is an innovative device capable of selecting and analyzing
a large number of sequences simultaneously, allowing a considerable reduction in the
amount of membranes produced. With this system, it is possible to elaborate membranes
with quality and specificity and automatically analyze the results obtained in the
immunoassays. In this way, all the techniques that would previously be performed
manually for the production and use of membranes for spot synthesis, can be automatic,
fast and easy, allowing the generation of results with better efficiency and quality and
transforming this technique into a powerful tool for complex analysis. To prove the
efficiency and effectiveness of the tool, two case studies were used: The complete
transcriptome analysis of Loxosceles laeta spiders of Peruvian origin and production of
SPOT membrane with transcripts of the main Micrurus snakes present in South America.
