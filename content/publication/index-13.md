abstract: In 2005-2006, a chikungunya epidemic of unprecedented magnitude hit Reunion Island, which raised a public health concern through the substantial proportions of long-lasting manifestations. To understand the pathophysiology underlying chronic chikungunya (CC), we designed the CHIKGene cohort study and collected blood samples from 133 subjects diagnosed with CC and from 86 control individuals that had recovered within 3 months, 12-to-15 years after exposure. We conducted bulk RNAseq analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene ontologies to uncover top-level enriched terms associated with DEGs, and weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to elucidate underlying cellular processes. Among 1549 DEGs, gene expression analysis identified 10 top genes including NR4A2 and TRIM58 (upregulated in CC), IGHG3 and IGHV3-49 (downregulated in CC) linked to immune regulation, OSBP2 (upregulated in CC) and SEMA6B (downregulated in CC) linked to neuronal homeostasis and axon guidance, respectively. GSEA and WGCNA unveiled cellular processes such as "Metabolism of RNA" and "Cell Cycle”. This study uncovers a shift in gene expression of CC subjects. IGHG3 and IGHV3-49 gene shut-offs spotlight the importance of neutralizing antibodies against chikungunya virus in the progression to chronic disease. Human diseases associations highlight connections to rheumatoid arthritis, nervous and cardiac systems. GSEA and WGCNA bounce the hypotheses of a persistent viral reservoir or an increased susceptibility to RNA viral pathogens with new onset infections. Together, our findings might offer potential targets for therapeutic options aimed at alleviating chronic chikungunya.
