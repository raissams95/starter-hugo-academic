abstract: Cervical cancer (CC) is a multifactorial disease of which human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main etiological agent. Despite cervical Pap smear screening and anti‑HPV vaccination, CC remains a major public health issue. Identification of specific gene expression signatures in the blood could allow better insight into the immune response of CC and could provide valuable information for the development of novel biomarkers. The present study performed a transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Senegalese patients with CC (n=31), low‑grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1; n=27) and from healthy control (CTR) subjects (n=29). Individuals in the CIN1 and CTR groups exhibited similar patterns in gene expression. A total of 182 genes were revealed to be differentially expressed in patients with CC compared with individuals in the CIN1 and CTR groups. The IL1R2, IL18R1, MMP9 and FKBP5 genes were the most upregulated, whereas the T‑cell receptor α gene TRA was the most downregulated in the CC group compared with in the CIN1 and CTR groups. The pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed pathways directly and indirectly linked to inflammation. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first large transcriptomic study on CC performed using PBMCs from African women; the results revealed the involvement of genes and pathways related to inflammation, most notably the IL‑1 pathway, and the involvement of downregulation of the T‑cell receptor α, a key component of the immune response. Several of the stated genes have already been reported in other cancer studies as putative blood biomarkers, thus reinforcing the requirement for deeper investigation. These findings may aid in the development of innovative clinical biomarkers for CC prevention and should be further replicated in other populations.
